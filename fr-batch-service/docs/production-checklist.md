# Production Readiness Checklist

This checklist must be completed before deploying the `fr-batch-service` plugin system to production.

---

## 🔒 Security

### JAR Signing

- [ ] **Strict signature enforcement enabled**: Set `app.plugins.signature.mode=strict` in production configuration.
- [ ] **Signing certificate trusted**: All uploaded JARs must be signed with a certificate from the trusted keystore.
- [ ] **Keystore secured**: The platform's truststore/keystore is stored in a secure location (not in source control).
- [ ] **Signature verification tested**: Upload a test JAR signed with an untrusted certificate and confirm rejection.
- [ ] **Unsigned JAR rejection verified**: Upload an unsigned JAR in strict mode and confirm HTTP 400 with appropriate error message.

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] **BCrypt passwords**: Replace `{noop}` plain-text passwords with `{bcrypt}` hashes. Use `PasswordEncoderFactories.createDelegatingPasswordEncoder()` or `BCryptPasswordEncoder` directly.
- [ ] **Strong passwords in use**: Admin and viewer passwords meet complexity requirements (≥12 chars, mix of upper/lower/digit/special).
- [ ] **HTTPS enabled**: All API traffic goes over TLS. Configure SSL in `application.properties` or via a reverse proxy (nginx, Traefik).
- [ ] **Role separation verified**: `PLUGIN_VIEWER` cannot execute upload, load, unload, approve, or execute operations.
- [ ] **Audit log tamper-proof**: Audit events are stored in a database table with restricted write access.

### Application Security

- [ ] **CSRF disabled confirmation**: CSRF protection is intentionally disabled for the REST API. Documented and accepted as a design decision.
- [ ] **Session management stateless**: `SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS` is configured.
- [ ] **No sensitive data in logs**: Verify that logs do not contain passwords, tokens, or PII from uploaded JAR metadata.
- [ ] **File upload limits configured**: `spring.servlet.multipart.max-file-size` is set appropriately for expected JAR sizes (e.g., 50MB).

---

## 📦 Storage

### JAR Directory

- [ ] **Directory exists and permissions correct**: `fr-batch-service.plugins.jar-dir` points to a writable directory (e.g., `/var/lib/fr-batch-service/plugins/jars/`).
- [ ] **Disk space monitoring**: Set up alerting when the JAR storage directory exceeds 80% of the partition capacity.
- [ ] **JAR cleanup policy**: Stale or disabled JARs are cleaned up periodically (manual or automated).
- [ ] **Backup strategy**: The JAR directory and database are backed up regularly. Include backup verification steps.

### Database

- [ ] **Flyway migrations validated**: All migration scripts in `db/migration` have been applied successfully.
- [ ] **Connection pool sized for production**: Review HikariCP `maximumPoolSize` and `minimumIdle` settings for expected load.
- [ ] **Database backup schedule**: Automated backups (e.g., daily full, hourly incremental) with point-in-time recovery capability.
- [ ] **JPA DDL auto disabled**: `spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl_auto=none` ensures no accidental schema changes.
- [ ] **Open session in view disabled**: `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false` avoids database connection leaks.

## 📊 Monitoring

### Health Checks

- [ ] **Plugin health endpoint accessible**: `GET /api/batch-service/actuator/health/plugins` returns accurate UP/DOWN status.
- [ ] **Health check integrated with load balancer**: The load balancer or orchestrator probes the health endpoint and removes unhealthy instances.
- [ ] **Alerting configured for DOWN state**: When the plugin health indicator returns DOWN, an alert fires (PagerDuty, Slack, email).

### Prometheus Metrics

- [ ] **Prometheus endpoint exposed**: `management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=prometheus`.
- [ ] **Prometheus scrape job configured**: A scrape config targets the `/api/batch-service/actuator/prometheus` path with a reasonable interval (e.g., 30s).
- [ ] **Key metric alerts configured**:

| Metric | Alert Condition | Severity |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| `plugins_uploaded_total` | Sudden spike (DoS indicator) | Warning |
| `plugins_loaded_count` | Drops to 0 (all plugins unloaded) | Critical |
| `plugins_load_duration_seconds` | Exceeds 30s (classloader issues) | Warning |
| `plugins_unload_duration_seconds` | Exceeds 10s (stuck unload) | Warning |
| `plugins_executed_total` | Flat for >1h for key jobs | Warning |
| JVM heap usage | >85% | Warning |
| JVM GC pause time | >1s | Warning |

- [ ] **Grafana dashboard created**: Build a dashboard showing plugin metrics over time, with panels for counter rates, gauge values, timer percentiles, and health status.

### Logging

- [ ] **Structured logging configured**: JSON log format for ingestion into centralized logging (ELK, Loki, Splunk).
- [ ] **Plugin lifecycle events logged**: Upload, load, unload, execution start/end, and errors are logged at INFO/WARN/ERROR levels.
- [ ] **Audit events logged separately**: Audit trail events have distinct log markers for compliance filtering.

## ⚖️ Scaling

### Plugin Limits

- [ ] **Maximum loaded plugins defined**: Establish a limit (e.g., 50 loaded plugins) based on memory testing. Monitor `plugins_loaded_count`.
- [ ] **Classloader memory profiling completed**: Each loaded plugin creates a `DynamicJobClassLoader`. Profile memory usage under simulated load (e.g., 20 concurrent plugins).
- [ ] **Metaspace monitoring**: Monitor `jvm_memory_used_bytes{area="metaspace"}`; excessive loaded classes may exhaust Metaspace.

### Known Limitations

- [ ] **No multi-instance coordination**: Plugin load/unload operations are local to a single JVM instance. In a multi-instance deployment:
  - Each instance must independently load its plugins.
  - No distributed consensus on load state — instances may diverge.
  - Load/unload via the load balancer hits only one instance unless sticky sessions are configured.
- [ ] **No horizontal plugin execution**: A single plugin job execution runs on a single instance. For distributed processing, use Spring Batch remote partitioning instead.
- [ ] **Plugin JAR size limit**: Very large JARs (>100MB) may cause high upload latency and increased Metaspace consumption at load time.

### Instance Sizing

- [ ] **Heap size**: Minimum 512MB per instance plus additional heap per loaded plugin (estimate 10-20MB per plugin for class metadata).
- [ ] **Metaspace**: Set `-XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m` minimum; increase based on the number and size of plugin JARs.
- [ ] **Thread pool**: Spring Batch's default `SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor` creates unbounded threads. Configure a bounded executor for production.

---

## ✅ Approval Workflow

- [ ] **Auto-approve disabled**: Set `app.plugins.approval.auto-approve=false` in production.
- [ ] **Approval policy documented**: Define who can approve job definitions, what checks are required (code review, security scan, performance test results).
- [ ] **Approval audit trail verified**: Every approval/rejection is recorded with timestamp, approver identity, and job name in the audit log.
- [ ] **Rejected jobs not loadable**: Verify that REJECTED job definitions cannot be loaded or executed.
- [ ] **Approval gating before load**: Load operation checks `approvalStatus == APPROVED` before proceeding.

---

## 🔄 Disaster Recovery

### JAR Recovery

- [ ] **JAR re-upload procedure documented**: If the JAR directory is lost, instructions exist for re-uploading JARs from artifact storage or rebuilding from source.
- [ ] **JAR checksum verification**: After re-upload, verify the SHA-256 checksum matches the value stored in the database (if DB was not lost).

### Database Recovery

- [ ] **Database backup restoration tested**: A full restore from backup has been practiced and documented.
- [ ] **Flyway migration replay verified**: After restore, `spring.flyway.enabled=true` applies any pending migrations on startup.
- [ ] **Recovery Time Objective (RTO) defined**: Maximum acceptable downtime for the plugin system (e.g., 4 hours).

### Rollback Plan

- [ ] **Plugin rollback procedure**: If a loaded plugin causes issues:
  1. `POST /jobs/definitions/{id}/unload?force=true` — unload the problematic plugin
  2. `DELETE /jobs/definitions/{id}` — remove the definition
  3. Upload the previous working version
- [ ] **Rollback tested**: A rollback drill has been completed within the RTO window.

---

## 🧪 Pre-Deployment Validation

- [ ] **All unit tests pass**: `mvn test -f fr-batch-service/pom.xml` — 120+ tests, 0 failures.
- [ ] **Integration tests pass**: All `@SpringBootTest` integration tests pass against a test database.
- [ ] **Plugin end-to-end test**: Full lifecycle test (upload → approve → load → execute → unload → delete) with a real plugin JAR.
- [ ] **Security scan**: Dependency vulnerability scan (`mvn dependency-check:check` or OWASP) with no critical/high findings.
- [ ] **Load test**: Simulate concurrent upload (5), load (5), and execution (10) operations. Verify no deadlocks, OOM, or excessive latency.

---

## 📝 Operational Runbooks

- [ ] **Startup procedure**: Documented steps for starting the service (JVM args, env vars, dependency startup order).
- [ ] **Shutdown procedure**: Graceful shutdown with `management.endpoint.shutdown.enabled=true` and step drain for running jobs.
- [ ] **Plugin lifecycle runbook**: Step-by-step for uploading, approving, loading, and executing a new plugin.
- [ ] **Incident response**: Triage steps for common failures (health DOWN, load failure, execution error, signature rejection).
- [ ] **Contact information**: On-call rotation or escalation contacts for plugin system issues.
