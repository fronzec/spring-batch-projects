# Example Batch Service

A **learning and experimentation project** for Spring Batch and Spring Framework features. This repository serves as a reference implementation showcasing different approaches to solve common batch processing challenges.

## Project Philosophy

This project intentionally demonstrates **multiple ways to implement similar functionality**. You may find:

- Different pagination strategies (offset-based vs keyset pagination)
- Various reader/writer implementations (JDBC vs JPA)
- Multiple configuration approaches (Java config, annotations)
- Different error handling patterns
- Various testing strategies

This diversity is by design - it provides an easy reference for how to implement things in different ways with Spring and Spring Batch.

## Tech Stack

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 4.0
- Spring Batch
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL 8.x
- Vavr (functional programming utilities)
- Micrometer + Prometheus (metrics)

## How to run locally

### Requeriments

- Your favorite IDE: I prefer IntelliJ or VsCode
- Java 21 SDK
- Maven 3, also you can use Maven Wrapper
- Mysql 8.0.23
- Some HTTP Rest Client: e.g. Postman
- Some mocking service alternative: e.g. Mockoon or Mockintosh

## Spring Batch Jobs

### Job1 - ETL Pipeline Demo

A 3-step pipeline demonstrating a complete ETL workflow:

| Step | Description | Reader | Writer |
|------|-------------|--------|--------|
| Step 1 | CSV to Database | `FlatFileItemReader` | `JdbcBatchItemWriter` |
| Step 2 | DB Transformation | Custom Keyset Pagination Reader | JPA Repository |
| Step 3 | DB to REST API | `JdbcPagingItemReader` | Custom REST Writer |

### Implementation Patterns Demonstrated

- **Keyset Pagination**: `Step2KeySetPagingItemReader` - efficient pagination for large datasets
- **Process Indicator Pattern**: Track which records have been processed
- **Chunk-oriented Processing**: Configurable chunk sizes per step
- **External API Integration**: REST client calls within batch processing

## HTTP Web Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/batch-service/jobs/run` | POST | Trigger job execution |
| `/api/batch-service/jobs/stop` | POST | Stop running jobs |
| `/api/batch-service/jobs/running` | GET | List running jobs |
| `/actuator/health` | GET | Health check |
| `/actuator/prometheus` | GET | Prometheus metrics |

## Roadmap for development experience

- [ ] Easy dev environment setup using docker, docker compose or podman and podman compose, using maven wrapper and
  reusing local m2 artifacs. Some limitations found here was the resources limitations for the DB container.
  - [x] Development environment using gitpod

## Roadmap for features included

- [ ] Allow run list of jobs sync and async
- [ ] At least one complex job using csv to db and db to rest endpoint
- [ ] Thirdparty services mocking using mockintosh
- [ ] Metrics with prometheus and grafana
- [ ] Web admin using svelte or react

## How to set up mock service powered by mockintosh
1. Fist install `pipx` to isolate `mockintosh` environment
2. Install `mockintosh` using pipx `pipx install mockintosh`. Latest version `0.13.17`
3. Sometimetimes mockintosh venv doesn't work correctly by incompatible version of `markupsafe`, install a compatible version with the
   mockintosh version using `pipx inject mockintosh markupsafe==2.0.1`
4. Test using `mockintosh --version` command
